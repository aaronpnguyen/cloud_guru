## Amazon S3 (2006)
- S3 is an Object Store
- Used in other AWS services, directly or indirectly
- Maximum object size is 5TB
- Largest object that can be PUT at a time is 5GB
- Recommended to use multi-part uploads if an object is greater than 100 MB

## S3 Object Store
- S3 path is a key, not a file path
    - Is more like a database than file system
    - Key is the name of the record that uniquely identifies the record

## S3 Security
- Resource-based
    - Object ACL (access control list)
    - Bucket Policies
- User-based
    - IAM Policies
- Optional multi-factor authentication before delete

## S3 Data Protection
- Versioning
    - New version with each write
    - Enables "roll-back" and "un-delete" capabilities
    - Old versions count as billable size until they are permanently deleted
    - Integrated with lifecycle management
- Mutli-factor authentication
    - Safeguard against accidental deletion of an object
    - Safeguard when changing the version state of the bucket
- Cross region replication
    - Security
    - Compliance
    - Latency

## S3 Storage Classes
- Standard
    - Frequently accessed data
- Standard-IA
    - Long-lived, infrequently accessed data
- One Zone-IA
    - Long-lived, infrequently accessed, non-critical data
- Reduced Redundancy
    - Frequently accesed, non-critical data
- Intelligent-Tiering (IT)
    - Has premiums, but costs are saved due to savings when changing an object's storage class
    - Long-lived data with changing or unknown access patterns
    - IT archive can move data to Glacier or DeepGlacier
- Glacier
    - Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours
- Glacier Deep Archive
    - Long-term data archiving with retrieval times within 12 hours

## S3 Lifecycle Management
- Optimize storage costs
- Adhere to data retention policies
- Keep S3 volumes well-maintained
    - Holding onto records and old versions of records can increase costs
- Applying lifecycle rules objects to transition from different storage classes or archives
    - Based off of prefixes, tags, or versions
    - Tags can be set on upload to delete objects after a certain amount of time

## S3 Analytics
- Data Lake Concepts (Enables datalake capabilities)
    - Athena
    - Redshift Spectrum
    - Quicksight

- IoT Streaming Data Repository
    - Kinesis Firehose

- Machine Learning and AI Storage (Can use S3 objects for training sets or ingest for AI processing)
    - Rekognition
    - Lex
    - MXNet

- Storage Class Analysis (Runs a report to see what data gets accessed frequently/infrequently)
    - S3 Management Analytics

## S3 Encryption at Rest
- SSE-S3
    - Use S3's existing encryption key for AES-256[1]

- SSE-C
    - Upload your own AES-256 encryption key which S3 will use when it writes the objects

- SSE-KMS
    - Use a key generated and managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

- Client-Side
    - Encrypt objects using your own local encryption process before uploading to S3 by using external encryption services or programs
        - PGP (Pretty good privacy)
        - GPG (GNU privacy guard)

## Other S3 Features
- Transfer Acceleration
    - Speed up uploads using CloudFront in reverse

- Requester Pays
    - The requester rather than the bucket owner pays for the data requests and transfers

- Tags
    - Assign tags to objects for use in costs, billing, security, or document filtering

- Events
    - Trigger notifications to SNS, SQS, or Lambda when certain events happen in your bucket

- Static Web Hosting
    - Simple and massively scalable static website hosting
